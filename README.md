Yodlr Take Home Challenge for Springboard

Yodlr was a take home project that I completed for the Springboard Software Engineering Program. The requirements were designed to mock a take home project from an employer for a frontend engineering position. In this take home project, I was asked to do two things:

1). Implement a page where a user could register to use the ficticious app. 
2). Create a (non-protected) Admin page where an "Admin" could view all users and update information on them as needed.
